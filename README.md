## ✉️ Contact Form & Formspree Integration

The contact form on this website allows college recruiters and coaches to send direct inquiries to Kelly. It features real-time validation, anti-abuse protection, and a live character counter for the message field.

### How the Contact Form Works
- **Form Submission**: When a user submits the form, the data is sent securely to Formspree, a third-party email service.
- **Validation**: The form checks for required fields, valid email format, and message length before allowing submission.
- **Spam Protection**: Includes honeypot fields, rate limiting, and content filtering to prevent abuse.
- **Character Counter**: Displays the number of characters typed in the message field (max 2000).
- **Success/Error Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on submission status.

### Formspree Dependency
- The contact form relies on [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to deliver messages to Kelly's email address.
- **Formspree** is a secure, privacy-focused service for handling form submissions without server-side code.
- No backend or database is required; Formspree acts as the intermediary, forwarding form data to a verified email address.
- The form is configured with a unique Formspree project ID and requires email verification for activation.

#### Basic Formspree Info
- **Free Tier**: Limited submissions per month, suitable for personal/recruitment sites.
- **Setup**: Add a Formspree endpoint to your form's `action` attribute and verify your email.
- **Security**: Supports spam filtering, CAPTCHA, and encrypted submissions.
- **Docs**: See [Formspree Documentation](https://formspree.io/docs/) for details.
